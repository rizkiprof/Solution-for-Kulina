Kulina, a food subscription startup has luch subscription product where a person can get daily special lunch delivered to her place with price as cheap as $1.2 per menu. To be able to do that, they have partneership with local caterers to sell and deliver their daily special menu to customers from the nearest supply partner. All Kitchen (caterers) are producing the same menu each day, so it doesn't matter where the customers getting their food from.

##The Challenge
Therefore, there's problem in how to find the nearest supply partner and arange the delivery. Able to find the nearest suppl partner will ensure food delivered on time and reduce delivery cost. In addition for reducing delivery cost, a delivery unit can deliver food to multiple customers in one jurney. However, they need to be careful not to spend long journey since food should be delivered during lunch time.

##Try to solve
In this Repository, I try to solve this problem of their using clustering and greedy technique and improve by using Priority Scale for each customer.
